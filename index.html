							<h2>My Coding Story</h2>
							<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy known as Bobby54. For Christmas, he was given a Computer. That's when it all began...</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-terminal"></span>
									<h3>Windows Shell</h3>
									<p>Actually it wasn't that long ago. I started my coding journey in 2015 writing little Scripts in the pre-installed Windows Text Editor and executed them as Bash scripts.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-laptop-code"></span>
									<h3>Java</h3>
									<p>Next on the list is Java. I started learning it in early 2016 using BlueJ, in the same year I also was supposed to learn Java in Computer Science class in school but by then my Java level was already far from the basics which I was being taught.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-robot"></span>
									<h3>Processing</h3>
									<p>I don't want to call it a different language, since Processing is more of a Java dialect than its own language but I still wanted to give it its own bullet point, since I spent a fair amount of time using this IDE. One massive advantage is the easy way in on graphic programming and the possibility of writing code for mobile devices and simply launching them on your phone via USB while using Java.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-gamepad"></span>
									<h3>Unity and Unreal Engine</h3>
									<p>During my Java time I also got some little experience in game development using Unity and Unreal Engine. After a short while however I moved on from game development and decided to keep it as sort of a hobby while focusing on Java again.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-copyright"></span>
									<h3>C</h3>
									<p>I started studying in the winter semester of 2021 and the first programming course was in C. While learning basic C we also had exercises with the graphic library cairo. We ahd access to replit.com. However, I only used this website for the first exercise and then decided to build my own compiler using gcc, msys64 and Atom as editor.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-keyboard"></span>
									<h3>C++</h3>
									<p>As of Sommer 2022 I've decided to take a closer look at C++ and advance my coding skills in another language. But this part is yet to be continued...</p>
